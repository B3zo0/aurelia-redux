# Todo App example with SN7, Aurelia and Redux

This example is simple todo app built with Aurelia+Redux upon Sense/Net ECM which has been prepared to demonstrate how to use the new Sense/Net ECM related libraries [sn-client-js](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-client-js)
and [sn-redux](https://github.com/SenseNet/sn-redux). The app and a steps of the related tutorial are based on two awesome Redux courses of Dan Abramov: 
[Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) and [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux). 
These two courses are extremely helpful and essential, recommended for everyone who is interested in building scalable apps with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).
